Defend the mountain strongholds of Souli against Ali Pasha’s relentless campaigns in this historically inspired real‑time‑strategy game built with Unity.
Between 1792 – 1803 the Souliote clans of Epirus fought to remain free from the powerful Ottoman ruler Ali Pasha of Ioannina. Souli 1792 lets you relive that struggle: marshal guerilla fighters, exploit the rough terrain and push back waves of Ottoman assaults.
This project was started as a learning exercise in Unity and has grown into a playable historical RTS.
